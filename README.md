This ### `Covid-19 Live Tracker` Was Made By ###`Chinmay Takkar`

###`Covid Watch` is a Covid-19 live tracker built using ###`Leaflet.js`, ###`Rapid API`, ###`React Hooks`, and ###`Material UI`. The project aims to provide up-to-date information on the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries of Covid-19 worldwide.

The frontend of the Covid Watch project is built using React Hooks and Material UI, a popular UI framework for React applications. Material UI provides a set of pre-designed components that can be easily customized to fit the project's design requirements.

The live data is fetched from the Rapid API Covid-19 API, which provides real-time data on Covid-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries. The data is then displayed on a map using Leaflet.js, a popular open-source library for interactive maps.

Users can interact with the map by zooming in and out to see the number of cases in different regions. Clicking on a specific country on the map will display more detailed information about the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries.

The project also includes a search bar that allows users to search for specific countries and see detailed information about Covid-19 cases in that region.

Overall, Covid Watch is a useful tool for people to stay informed about the latest Covid-19 statistics and track the spread of the virus worldwide.
